  Always try to express in a code in first place use comments only if not explainable in the 
  code .

Good Comments :

   The good comment is a comment that we find a way not to write  

Legal comments :

 Comments for copyrights 

Informative comments :

 If a comment can be  named as a function Nmme choose that instead of adding comments 
 If we can create a class to intent the content for the code instead of comments

Explaining the intent :

 Reason for why we does  this in a code 

Clarification :

 To Clarify the part of code 

  eg : asserttrue a compare b ==1  //a>b

Warning of Consequences :

ToDO comments 

They are the jobs that the programmer things to be done but cannot be done at this moments

insuficient commennt for justifacation

Closing Brace  :

Unwanted comments to ensure the closed brace

Attributing and Bylines :
